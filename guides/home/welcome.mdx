At Lerian, we believe in empowering financial institutions to take control of their own evolution. We challenge conventions by merging cutting-edge technology with deep financial expertise, enabling organizations to build scalable, adaptable, and independent financial ecosystems.

This section shows you how to use the latest version of Lerian’s platform and plugins in real-world scenarios.

<Warning>
  You’re viewing the documentation for the latest version of **Midaz** and its plugins. If you’re working with an earlier release, check out the [legacy docs](https://docs.lerian.studio/v2/docs)  to avoid version mismatches.

From setting up your first ledger to creating complex workflows with Smart Templates and CRM integrations, the Guides walk you through real use cases, best practices, and step-by-step instructions, all designed to help you build with confidence.
